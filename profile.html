	<h1>My Story:</h1>
	<p>I studied business at Temple University and graduated with a dual major of Finance and Risk Management.  I worked in the financial sector for ten years before attempting to take my education to the next level.  I studied part time at LaSalle University in order to earn an MBA.</p>
	<p>After 12 years, I felt the need for my next challenge in life.  I pursued a new career in financial services.  I felt confident that with my large network and strong financial background, that I would be success.  I realized quickly that I was not a salesman.  Although I did not want to accept failure, I was forced to after several months of ineffectiveness.</p>
	<p>I took a seasonal accounting position while I tried to decide what to do with the rest of my life.  I was convinced by a close friend that I needed to explore the field of information technology.  I attended a Java boot camp with Mindteck Academy and then decided to enter the web development boot camp at NYCDA.</p>
	<p>I hope that I can transition into this new field while being able to leverage my experience in finance, accounting, and insurance.</p>
